# pyprac

A repository to contain python scripts I wrote for fun.

## Current Progress
- Mood Calculator
    - A python script to calculate mood an individual through a set of questions.
    - It contains a score based calculator for mood.
    - **Note**: This calculator may not be accurate because score and mood bindings are highly experimental.

## Contributing
Although it is a personal fun project, I would be happy to recieve a Pull Request that would improve the functionality of these scripts :)
